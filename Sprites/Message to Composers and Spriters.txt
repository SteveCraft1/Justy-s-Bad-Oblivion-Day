To make the things more faster i'm gonna teach things about Openbor that you guys gonna need to understand to save everyone from losing hours of converting musics and sound files,and
of sprites(especially sprites since this gonna be alot harder for us to NOT lose hours)

Message to Everyone:on the repository,you will find a folder named data,enter the folder and you will find many folders inside,you might think that only the folders's name will gonna help
easily to understand what to do,but Openbor engine is more strict with musics,sounds and sprites,so if nobody here want to lose some hours only trying to understand why the game is crashing(because some file is not being read or working correctly)
Follow these steps to solve it more easier our problems and save everyone from some unnecessary hours losed with me taking too much time
i'm gonna only mention necessary things for you guys understand instead of talking too much

How Openbor on music and sound effects work:Openbor only read two type of music file,OGG and BOR,i recommend for the composers after they made the musics,convert the files to OGG and put
on the folder named "music",on this point you guys might think that i'm probably wrong about the folders name not helping you guys but some folders inside data are actually not normally used
by Openbor engine,one of them is music folder,however,these folders have obvious names to make it easier to know where to put files,BUT if you touch on some texts files,you can put music
using another path instead of music folder
Ex: music(<=command) Justy-s-Bad-Oblivion-Day/data/Chars/IvanTheme.ogg(<=the file type need to be included but its my part to use commands)
This is one example where it show that i'm able to choose the path of where the music file gonna be used,only some specific files names are used by having to be on music folder,such as 
Complete.bor and GAMEOVER.bor.
Now i'm gonna say how to put files inside of some folder
Step 1:Go to the folder you want to put the file inside,then press on "Add File" then press on upload files,then you drag the file to the part where it says "Drag files here to add them to your repository"

Step 2:Then after the file is loaded,you type on "Add files via upload",the name of the music/sound you uploaded and which folder(i'm saying the folder you was inside,not the entire path or
only "data" folder),then press on "commit changes",then its done

This was the part for the composers,on the spriters side,its gonna be MUCH different,you guys gonna do the sprites and(unfortunately) put them in spritesheet type(make sure that every sprite of the character is on the spritesheet)
then you guys gonna go on the main part(where openbor.exe is) and put on a folder named "sprites"(do the same as the composers,go into the folder and all that process),about what message
you gonna give when the commit change happens is,[name of the character]'s spritesheet was uploaded on sprites.

REMEMBER:Spriters only gonna upload the spritesheet when its truly done.
